This article shows you how to send a WhatsApp message in `Java`.

Before the recipient can receive your WhatsApp message, she will need to register with the WhatsMate WA Gateway. Instructions are available on the [official site](http://www.whatsmate.net/whatsapp-gateway.html). *Unregistered users will never receive messages from the Gateway.*


To send a WhatsApp message in `Java`, do this:

1. Copy the following source code to a Java file named `WhatsappSender.java`.  <script src="https://gist.github.com/whatsmate/ada1343baa4f7364d3e1.js"></script>
2. Specify your target recipient on line 17. Remember to include the country code.
3. Specify your message on line 18.
4. Compile the Java file:  `javac WhatsappSender.java`
5. Execute the class to send your message: `java WhatsappSender`


The trial account allows you to send up to 40 messages per day. [Upgrade to the Premium Account](http://www.whatsmate.net/premium-account.html) to send unlimited number of messages.
