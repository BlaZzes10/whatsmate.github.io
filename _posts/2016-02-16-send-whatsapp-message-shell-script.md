This article shows you how to send a WhatsApp message from a shell script.

Before the recipient can receive your WhatsApp message, she will need to register with the WhatsMate WA Gateway. Instructions are available on the [official site](http://www.whatsmate.net/whatsapp-gateway.html). *Unregistered users will never receive messages from the Gateway.*


To send a WhatsApp message from a shell script, do this:

1. Copy the following source code to your script.  <script src="https://gist.github.com/whatsmate/10c75499502a2ededc23.js"></script>
2. Specify your target recipient on line 8. Remember to include the country code.
3. Specify your message on line 9.
4. Make your script executable: `chmod 755 send-whatsapp.sh`
5. Run the script to send your message: `./send-whatsapp.sh`


The trial account allows you to send up to 40 messages per day. [Upgrade to the Premium Account](http://www.whatsmate.net/premium-account.html) to send unlimited number of messages.
