This article shows you how to send a WhatsApp message in VBA / Visual Basic Script.

Before the recipient can receive your WhatsApp message, she will need to register with the WhatsMate WA Gateway. Instructions are available on the [official site](https://www.whatsmate.net/whatsapp-gateway.html). *Unregistered users will never receive messages from the Gateway.*




To send a WhatsApp message in VBA / VB Script, do this:

1. In your Excel / Access / VBA development environment, define the following subroutines:  <script src="https://gist.github.com/whatsmate/dd1a1b80342b87f778ef732bb5a12582.js"></script>
2. Specify your target recipient and message on line 4. Remember to include the country code in the recipient's number.
3. Run it.


The trial account allows you to send up to 40 messages per day. [Upgrade to the Premium Account](https://www.whatsmate.net/premium-account.html) to send unlimited number of messages.
