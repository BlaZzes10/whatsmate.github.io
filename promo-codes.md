## 2. (The Only?) Ethical Domain Name Company

I switched to *NameCheap.com* from "GxDxddy.com" (real name hidden) to register all my domain names last year. Here is why:

1. Because of my very bad experience with "GxDxddy.com". I had been using their services for many years. 
But last year, I searched for some domain names that I liked on a particular day. I didn't buy them right away because I wanted 
to give it some more thought. A week later, I went back there and wanted to register those domain names. You know what happened?
They hijacked them! They asked for a much higher price for the domains that I would have gotten for $10 each 
if I had registered them on day one.
That was it. I decided to leave and do business with a domain name company that I can trust.

2. I googled for the most trustworthy domain name company to switch to. *NameCheap.com* was (and still is) the top match. 
Initially, I was a bit skeptical. But my experience with them over the past year tells me that they provide very reliable services,
and most importantly - they do business with ethics (they never hijack/steal my domain names). Their domain name management tool is very easy to use too! Last but not least, they sell domain names at very competitive price!

So, if you need a new domain name, I highly recommend *[NameCheap.com](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.namecheap.com&#x2F;?aff=104719)*:
